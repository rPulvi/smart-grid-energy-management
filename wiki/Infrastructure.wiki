#summary This page describes the concept behind the project


= The Goal =

Suppose the city divided into neighborhoods.
Each neighborhoods is a mesh. The mesh is made up of peers (aka `Buildings`) that are able to exchange messages to contract for energy supplies based on their needs.
Each mesh contains a special peer called `Resolver`. The `Resolver` builds the main mesh exposing the `Local Resolver Service`; it also exposes a `Remote service` that will be described next.

Each neighborhoods is represented by the Resolver.

= P2P =

The `Resolver` has a special rule in the mesh: forwarding messages to other Resolvers (neighborhoods) in the city to provide energy for its local peers. This is done using a real P2P system.
When a `Building` needs more Energy it sends a special request to its own `Resolver` and this will provide to forward the message to the next Resolver.
Each `Resolver` have a `NetConfig.xml` file associated that describes its knowledghe of the net. When a `Resolver` connects to a Remote `Resolver` it will update the `NetConfig.xml` file downloading the remote file and merging the contacts list.
The struct of the `NetConfig.xml` file is the following

{{{
